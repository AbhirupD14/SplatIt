Day 1

Research paper for reference to 3D Gaussian Splatting:
https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/

Start of project. First step is thinking about how the internals of the library will work.

Info on hiding internals of script that should not be accessible:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36008595/how-to-design-a-library-public-api-avoiding-to-expose-internals


Plan is to create a class that holds all the methods and expose only the method that generates the output file given the recording path.

Day 2
-----

Working on frame extraction. Need to turn the video into a depth map to generate the point cloud from SFM. Depth map will allow 
for mapping from 2D space to 3D space for the point cloud. 

Tools for frame extraction:

OpenCV

Tools for depth map generation:

Day 3
-----

Just researched more on point clouds and depth maps. Nothing added to code.

Day 4
-----

Reseraching SfM (Structure from Motion). Looking into source videos to feed into program.
